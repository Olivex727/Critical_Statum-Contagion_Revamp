THE INTERNATIONALIST MANIFESTO

Official SOIA approval. Confidential material.

While the Soviet Communist Party (CPNSU) remains strong in their government control. It is still imperative that we attempt to prevent the libertarianisation of the NSU by reinvigurating the popularity of internationalisation - which will encourage a global federalisation effort. We have an opportunity to do this, as the opposition party, the Party Internationale (PI), still has a 32% hold in the NSU's legislature.

For SOIA agents unaware of the history of these terms, libertarianisation is the process by which a socialist state decentralises it's control in order to grant more power to the general population. This process involves 'organisational fracturing', where the power of local government, unions, and cooperatives are bolstered - it is seen by the CPNSU as a neccesary step towards communism.

Clearly from the perspective of the governments of Oceana and the Middle Kingdom, this is a threat to national security and the sovereignty of both nations. We want to prevent a domino effect of libertarianisation coming to our nations and destablising the power of the state. Thus it is imperative of SOIA to discourage libertarianisation at all costs.

Past governments have tried in to create external pressure, which don't end in overwhelming success; but if push comes to shove, SOIA will aid in an embargo effort of the European Peninsula. This is why the best way forward is to manufacture a national crisis, which may sway the NSU pubic opinion towards remaining in the international community instead of decentralising. There are many paths to take, however it is the beleif of government officials that a drug crisis may be of the greatest benefit to destroy government trust.
