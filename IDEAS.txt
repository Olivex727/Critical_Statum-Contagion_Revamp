Add the region of 'Siam' or 'Middle Kingdom'. Make it so that SAC-2 was sponsored by the
Sino-Oceanic Intellegence Agency (SOIA) to quell rebellions in Siam. Siam gained independence
in 2230s. Xenith was hired to develop the first 3 strains. In Siam, the team will encounter an
accidental outburst of experimental SAC-3.

Due to the Mitapol scandal (2256-59), which was caused when some of the NUN Council was found
sponsoring the Southex-Stellarim independnence wars (a colour revolution as Southex was libsoc)
through a company called Mitapol. Xenith was not found out despite developing a dormant SAC-8
strain in Stellarim colour revolutionaries to force them into the NUN after sessesion.

Then the UNPIC (New United Nations Prosecutorial Investigation Commitee, 2263-2266) corruption bust
occured, which prevented many hidden documents from leakage. This mean Xenith was gaining more funds
from the NUN to develop SAC-15.

In the early 2280s, a drug crisis was manufactured by Oceana to prevent the Neo-Soviets from
libertarianising, reducing a trust in anarchism and more in internationalism. Xenith used the strain
SAC-18B as a conduit for hacking the dopamine pathway. The crisis spilled over after a fabricated bust in 2281.

Oceana, unhappy with Xenith's accidental spill-over, threatened arrest. However Xenith escaped without
being caught to a planet in the border regions. He spent the next 4 years developing towards SAC-26,
and planned to make SAC-27. Xenith was infected by SAC-22, an earlier work developed in 2284.
This is when Operation Contagion began.

SAC-27 kills all biological non-humans after 50 years. SAC-26 causes a serious international crisis, but not a genocide. The SAC series was a Silicon-based parasite as it could easily bypass the human immune system (the original intent of it's use). However Xenith mutated it to kill non-human aliens (Colorans and Spirons).
